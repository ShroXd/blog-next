# Atriiy

Hi, I'm Atriiy, an interest-driven dev.

I'm not good at introducing myself not only in reality but also on the web. But even if I can escape, I still have to face it. So, the following is my introduction.

Dev, using React and TypeScript. Vim fans. Eighteen plus seven years old now, still have hair, wanna learn many things.

Writing, reading, playing video games.

Ok, stop right here.
