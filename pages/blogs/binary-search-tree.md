# Overview

__Symbol table__ (also called a __dictionary__) is a common data structures and many major programming languages have their own built-in implementations. The idea of symbol table is also pretty straightforward, create a data structure, store the key-value pairs in it. We can just search the key to get the value, just like we use a real dictionary. Benefit from the way it's implemented, the speed of searching is fast.
