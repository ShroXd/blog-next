# Overview

We have discussed the binary search tree. It's a practical data structure that offers $O(lgn)$ time complexity for searching, insertion, and deletion in the average case. But ironically, in the worst case, the time complexity for those functions will be $O(n)$; and it happens when we insert items orderly. In this situation, the binary search tree degenerates into a linked list.
